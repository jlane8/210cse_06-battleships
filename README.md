# Battleships
A former friendly has just declared war on you! You are the commander of a small navy fleet (six ships of diminishing size). Your computer opponent has the same. The computer sets up both fleets, hiding the opposing forces. Like all wars, there are some things in your favor and some against. In your favor is the targeting accuracy of your shots and the poor accuracy of the enemy. Against you is the new stealth capability of your opponent and the abundance of ammunition they have will use. You take turns targeting and hitting your opponent's ships. Whoever eliminates the opposing fleet first, wins. 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

py battleships
python3 battleships 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- rfk                 (source code for game)
  +-- data              (data files for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
